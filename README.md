# 🎮✨ Arduino + ESP32 Interactive LED Projects  

Welcome to this collection of **fun & interactive projects** built using **Arduino & ESP32**.  
These projects explore **LED patterns, games, and gesture controls** 🔥  

---

## 📌 Projects Overview  

### 1️⃣ Dynamic LED Patterns  
- LEDs light up in creative, continuously updated patterns 🌈  
- Frequency & sequence of patterns change dynamically  
- Perfect for learning **basic Arduino LED control**

### 2️⃣ ESP32 LED Reaction Game  
- A **2-player reaction game** where players compete to press first ⚡  
- Controlled via **ESP32 Web Server** (WiFi AP mode)  
- Displays **live scores** with reset option  
- Fun way to explore **ESP32 + Web + IoT**

### 3️⃣ Gesture Controlled LED Game  
- Play the reaction game **without touching buttons** 🙌  
- Uses **hand gesture recognition (MediaPipe + Python)**  
- Gestures trigger **HTTP requests** to ESP32 server to control LEDs  
- Great intro to **Computer Vision + IoT integration**
